piradio
=======
A web radio based on the Raspberry Pi.

piradio is a custom-built web radio based on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) platform. In contrast to other Pi web radio hacks it contains a nice LCD screen and hardware button interface. piradio focusses on the following three **goals**:

1. Rock-solid streaming audio playback.
2. Over-night downloading of podcasts.
3. Be easy to use (for me).

DESIRE
Build up the action. Make them really want it.

ACTION
What do you want people to do?
