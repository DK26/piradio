The code in this folder is based on the Raspi LCD demo code by Martin Steppuhn (http://www.emsystech.de/produkt/raspi-lcd/) that is available here: http://www.emsystech.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RaspiLCD-V0.9.0.zip

It was further modified by Michael Ziegler: https://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/raspilcd

Michael changed the file encoding to UTF-8 and modified the makefile to build an lcd.so dynamic library. I use this library to use Martin's Raspi LCD from Python.
